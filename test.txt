I have been deliberating on whether or not to report the following activites for a long time. I have finally decided to report the following activities because the situation is getting worse and is beginning to impact many other people as well as potentially jeopardize Boeing's relationship with NASA if certain aspects of this situation continue to escalate.

The following people are involved and are the ones who perpetuate the situation:
Douglas Corbin (BEMSID: 225584)
Terrel McClaine (BEMSID: 227928)
Laura Allen (BEMSID: 1567115)

First of all, there has been and still is a heavy amount of romantic activity between these three people. All three work with the Space Shuttle Backup Flight Systems (BFS) under the Flight Systems & Software Engineering branch.

McClaine is married with children and lives in Huntington Beach, CA. He visits Houston frequently and thus continues his affair with Laura, who is 24 years younger than McClaine.

Corbin and McClaine are very close friends and are comfortable sharing their sexual relationship with Laura.

Corbin lives in Houston and has frequent encounters with Laura, often during business hours. Both, especially Laura, have been inappropriatelly reporting their time in ETS. Laura leaves often during the day for long periods of time and leaves work early a lot.

Another un-ethical apsect of this triangular relationship is that McClaine and Corbin, both managers, are members of the BFS Qualification Board. This boards responsibility is to test and qualify and certify BFS staff. They must examine the compentency levels of all BFS staff. Failure to do this inappropriatelly could jeopardize contractual relationships between Boeing and NASA if NASA were to find out. Many people are becoming more and more aware of this situation. Laura Allen must take an examine tomorrow, January 18, given by this board. This is one of many exams she must complete in order to achieve her proper certification. Two men that she is romantically invloved with are members of this board and I believe that this is a conflict of interest since their bias could influence the way they conduct the exam and grade Laura's results. This is unfair to the rest of us. 

These people talk frequently, but are wise not to use company resources too much. Please investigate this situation as carefully as possible because they are often discrete and will lie for one another. It would be wise to interview sub contractors in the BFS teams as well since a few of them are well aware of this situation.
